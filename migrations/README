Single-database configuration for Flask.

What is the migrations folder?
The migrations folder is a history of changes to the database. The database is where the website stores its data (you can think of it like a spreadsheet). 
These files let the app rebuild the database structure on a new computer and keep track of how the structure has changed over time.

The most important folder: versions
Inside migrations/versions are the actual “change files.” Each file is like a step in the history of the database. 
When you set up the app again, these files are run in order so the database structure matches the app.

What each file does:
- f6d6d4fc24d7_initial_migration_with_quantmathresult_.py:
  Updates the quant_math_result table. It adds four new timing columns 
(mean_bayes_time, mean_coupon_time, mean_option_time, mean_ev_time) and removes two older ones (mean_time, time_per_question). 
In simple terms, it replaces old timing fields with more specific ones.

- 7f358d1e78f2_removed_uniqueness_constraints.py:
  Removes the poker_club_members table and makes important fields in the poker_members table required (email, first_name, last_name, course, year, sex). 
In simple terms, it deletes an old table and makes sure key fields can’t be left empty.

Other files in migrations:
- README: this explanation.
alembic.ini:
This is the settings file for the migration system. 
It controls things like logging (what messages you see), and general behavior of the migration tool. 
You usually don’t touch it unless you need to change how migrations are generated or logged.

env.py:
This is the “bridge” between your app and the migration system. 
It grabs your app’s database connection and metadata so Alembic knows what tables/columns exist and can apply changes correctly. 
It also decides whether migrations run “offline” (just generating SQL text) or “online” (actually connecting to the database).

script.py.mako:
This is the template used to make new migration files. 
When you create a new migration, Alembic uses this file as the blueprint so every new migration has the same structure (upgrade section, downgrade section, revision IDs, etc.).

Why this matters:
If you ever move to a new computer or rebuild the project, these files tell the app exactly how to build the database structure so the website works the same way.
